# Baltimore

I Can Hear The Bells...

## What?

A set of scripts to allow a pair of Raspberry Pis to remotely power up an amplifier and make noise.

## How?

### Prerequisites

You'll need all of the following. A stock Raspbian installation should come with them:

* Python to actually run the scripts.
* [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) to handle the audio mixing.

You'll also need the pip prerequisites (make sure you're in the venv first):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
